There was once a lonely farmer who lived in a village deep in the mountains.
After a century of sleep, one day, tremors shook the valley...
the great dragon that had fell from the heavens was calling the man's name.
The sky split open, and out came the behemoth with its minions.

As he flew bloodstained towards the beast, he only remembered one thing...
his wife's final words -
"Protect the village... protect my home"
