### TODO:
- [ ] limit stickman's height and length of arms
- [x] a way for the demons to slow down after a certain speed is reached, and do _something_
- [ ] when the above happens, a boss will appear. randomly-colored, and will keep bouncing around the screen and moving closer to the player
- [ ] after the boss fight, the _something_ should occur - could be different types of demons that are harder to hit
- [x] player health system
- [ ] score meter (score variable is there. just need meter)
